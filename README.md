Covered Literature Review, visualising coherent structures on Tecplot360 and established Q-criterion for the 3 velocity components.
This serves as a reference for Task 2.

For Task 3, Updates to (Assignment/assignment.mlx) has been modified to read data samples, calculate the mean and standard deviation of the velocity components and ...
plot them on figures. The gradient has also been calculated and plotted. The accuracy of the gradient values is in doubt and further investigation is needed.

The (Assignment/symbolic.mlx) file has been newly added today. This is an attempt at Task 5 in which I attempt to use Symbolic functions to obtain the wall - normal 
mean velocity componenet and plot it.
